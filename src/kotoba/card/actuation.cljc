(ns kotoba.card.actuation
  "What happens AFTER a decision. Deliberately separate from kotoba.card.ports.

  `kotoba.card.ports` is propose-only, and says so: a host that actuates inside
  one of those methods has moved a licensed act behind an interface that reads as
  a query. That rule leaves a hole -- once a governor has cleared a proposal and a
  licensed operator has approved it, SOMETHING has to actually issue the card. This
  namespace is that something, and it is a different protocol on purpose so the
  difference is visible at every call site: `ports/issue-card` drafts, and
  `actuation/issue-card!` does.

  Three properties every implementation must have, and which a caller may rely on:

  1. NOTHING HERE RUNS WITHOUT AN APPROVAL. Each function takes an `approval`
     map carrying at minimum `{:by <who> :reference <what was approved>}`, and an
     implementation MUST refuse a call whose approval is absent or unnamed. An
     actuation nobody is named for cannot be audited, which is most of the reason
     the gate exists.

  2. EVERY CALL IS IDEMPOTENT ON A CALLER-SUPPLIED KEY. `:idempotency-key` is
     required, not optional. A retried issue-card! must not produce a second live
     card -- this is the same discipline kotoba-lang/stripe-ops states for payment
     links, and the failure mode here is worse.

  3. REFUSALS ARE DATA. Implementations return
     {:card/ok? false :card/refusal {...}} rather than throwing, so a governed
     actor can record what the provider said. A thrown exception loses the reason
     somewhere up the stack.

  The state vocabulary is kotoba.card.lifecycle's, which mirrors the issuer side's
  own. A provider whose upstream has FEWER states than that (Stripe Issuing has
  three where the lifecycle has five) must publish its mapping rather than absorb
  the difference silently -- see `state-mapping-complete?`.

  No credential, endpoint or SDK lives in this library. Portable (.cljc).

  ## Kotoba migration status: :blocked (measured 2026-09-09)

  This component stays `.cljc`, and the reason is asserted rather than written
  down: `test/kotoba/card/actuation_kotoba_blocked_probe.cljs`.

  Protocols are not missing from the language -- a protocol whose implementations
  are in the same compiled graph compiles and RUNS correctly. What is refused is
  the PORT shape, a method called on a value whose record the module does not
  statically know (`:kotoba.error/protocol-dispatch`), and that is exactly what
  the two protocols below are: their implementers live in other repositories on
  purpose. `lang/surface-status.edn` names the profile
  `:bounded-closed-world-static-dispatch`.

  The refusal is `:disposition :implemented-partial` -- implementation state, not
  a permanent design decision -- so this component is NOT redesigned to fit it.
  The pure half would move today, but moving only that is a decision-only slice,
  which `q9-migration.edn` v3 forbids (`:decision-only-slices-allowed false`).

  The probe goes RED the day open-world dispatch is admitted. Nobody has to
  remember."
