;; The oracle is itself a MIRROR of the deployed issuer side
;; (cloud-itonami-card-issuing's `cardissuing.governor/legal-predecessor` and
;; `cardissuing.store/lifecycle!`), and its own docstring says a mirror that
;; disagrees with its subject is worse than no mirror. The guest is now a third
;; copy of the same table, so this test compares EVERY state x event pair -- 6
;; states (the five plus one unknown) times 5 events (the four plus one unknown),
;; every one of them, not a sample.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest (require-graph).
;;
;; The negative control is `activate-must-not-be-legal-from-blocked`: the oracle's
;; own test is named after that guess, because unblocking is NOT an activate -- the
;; issuer side's recovery path from :blocked is :reissue. A guest that allowed it
;; would let a consent surface wave through a transition the governor refuses,
;; which is the wasted approval this namespace exists to prevent.
